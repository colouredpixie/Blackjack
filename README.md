# Blackjack
A Qt and C++ test game of Blackjack

The game is using sound effects, animation, adding user image as card reverse and C++ logic

Basic rules:
- The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.
- Face cards(king, for example) are worth 10. Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever makes a better hand. Card`s with number value equals to its number.
- Each player starts with two cards, one of the dealer's cards is hidden(cardâ€™s back is rendered) until the end.
- To 'Hit' is to ask for another card. To 'Stand' is to hold your total and end your turn.
- If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand.
- You have some starting balance and can increase/decrease bet value, but it can`t be zero.
